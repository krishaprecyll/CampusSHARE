  # Add Admin Access Policies

  1. New Policies
    - Admins can view all users, items, rentals, deliveries, transactions
    - Admins can manage user roles and statuses
    - Admins can manage all items and rentals
    - Admins can view all analytics data

  2. Security
    - All admin policies check for user role = 'admin' from the users table
    - Only authenticated admins have access to admin-only data
    - Audit trail is maintained through timestamps

  3. Important Notes
    - Admins must have role='admin' in the users table
    - These policies work in conjunction with existing RLS policies
    - No data is deleted by admins, only status changes are made
